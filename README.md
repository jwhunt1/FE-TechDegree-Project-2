# Front End TechDegree Project 2
 In the second project of my Front End TechDegree with Treehouse, I was tasked with recreating designs provided to me with mock up images of the final desired product in three different screen sizes, 320px, 768px, and 1024px. My goal was to recreate these in a mobile first approach, building up from 320px to match the mock up designs of each size through media queries. 
 
This project was created using HTML & CSS, built in VS Code, and tested in Chrome Version 77.0.3865.90 and Mozilla Firefox Version 70.0
